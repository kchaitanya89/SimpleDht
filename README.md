# SimpleDht
Implementation of simple DHT based on Chord. Although the design is based on Chord, it is a simplified version of Chord. Finger tables and finger-based routing are not implemented. Also, node leaves/failures are not handled. The three things implemented are 1) ID space partitioning/re-partitioning, 2) Ring-based routing, and 3) Node joins.
